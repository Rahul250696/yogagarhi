                  Every human being is unique. Your body, your energy, your mind — they are unlike 
                  anyone else's. So why should your yoga practice be the same as everyone else's?
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Yogagarhi, we teach multi-style yoga not to confuse, but to liberate. 
                  By understanding Hatha, Vinyasa, Ashtanga, and Iyengar as complete systems, 
                  you learn to adapt yoga to the individual — not force the individual into yoga.

                  Our Prakriti-based approach considers your unique constitution. We help you 
                  discover which practices serve your nature, so your teaching can be truly 
                  responsive to each student who comes to you.
